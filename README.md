## Installation
This app utilizes npm for package management. Dependencies include dotenv, express, mysql2, and sequelize. Users can run 'npm i' in the terminal to install all dependencies.

## Usage
First, users need to run a MySQL server on their computer. The command can vary, but if Homebrew was used to download MySQL, the command 'brew service start mysql' can be ran in the terminal to start a server. Then, users should run 'node seeds/index.js' in the terminal to seed the database. After that, users can run 'node server.js'  in the terminal to start the app. The server is ran on localhost port 3001 by default, but can be changed within the server.js file if needed. Once the server is running, routes can be tested using an API tester such as Insomnia or MySQL Workbench.
